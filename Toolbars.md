## Toolbars and Tool Windows

The workspace has may toolbar and tool windows to make working with files fairly easy and intuitive. Right clicking on the top bar of the app will allow you to toggle toolbars on or off, as will using the 'Window' menu in the main menu bar.

### Manipulating Tool Windows and Tabs

You can undock a tool window and make it floating by dragging it away from the other tool windows. You can also click the min/max button in the upper right of the tool window to undock it.

You can dock the tool window by itself by dragging it to the right or left of the screen and dropping it in an area that highlights blue when you hover over it.

You can dock the tool window as a tab by dropping it on top of another docked tool window.

You can close a tool window by clicking the X in the upper right of the tool window or by turning it off in the toolbar context menu as seen in the [Tools and Toolbars](#toolbars) section above.

You can reorder tabs by clicking on the tab and dragging it left or right in the tab strip.

### Cuts

The Cuts tool window is where you will configure most of your job. It contains layers of cut operations that can be reordered and have various machine operations configured.  Details of the possible Modes and settings are covered in the [Operations](Operations.md) section.

![Cut Tool WIndow](/img/CutsToolBox.PNG)

* A right click on a cut layer will cause the items that are on that cut layer to flash in the workspace. 
* Double clicking a cut layer will launch the full settings editor for that layer
* You can quickly select the Mode or set the layer Output and Hide options directly from the tool window
* You can quickly set the basic operation parameters in the *Cut Info* section
* Clicking the up or down arrows on the right side of the tool window will move the selected layer up or down in priority (as will editing the Priority value below)

### File List

This is currently for Ruida controllers, but will be implemented for Smoothie controllers as well. This window lets you manage the files hosted on your controller, if it supports this.

![FileListWindow](/img/FileListWindow.png)

Hit the Refresh button to query your controller for the list of hosted files. You can select a file and press Start to cut it or Delete to remove it from the controller. Pressing Upload will let you choose a local cut file to send to the controller (this is not the same as the current job, which you can upload with the "Send" button in the Laser window - see the [Machine Instructions](MachineInstructions.md) page for more details). Be careful with the Delete All Files button.

### Laser

The Laser tool window is used to interact with the connected device. 

![Laser Tool Window](/img/LaserToolBox.PNG)

This tool window provides most of the functions for interacting directly with your laser. The commands are covered in detail elsewhere in the documentation. You can also enable the rotary here, as well as change the job origin.

For a detailed explanation of the *Start From* options, see [Coordinates and Origin](CoordinatesOrigin.md)

### Move

The Move tool window is used primarily for Jog and Home functions

![Move Tool Window](/img/MoveToolBox.PNG)

Here you can manually jog your laser head to different positions by selecting one of the arrow buttons around the home button. This will move your head by the set distance, speed and power entered in the toolbox. 

You can also set or clear a custom origin or get the current reported position.

### Shape Properties

Shape properties is used for setting a percentage of power for a given shape. This allows you to set different shapes within the same layer to a higher or lower laser power percentage without creating a new layer. This is especially useful for creating test patterns and is covered in detail in the Video [LightBurn progress demo #9 - Power Scaling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZiUAOv4tAGY) You can also choose what direction the shape should be cut in. This will be used by the cut planner to determine the cut direction.

### Console

On non-Ruida machines, a console toolbox is available for directly inputting commands. You can type a command in the text box and the console will output the results. Examples would be manual G-Code commands or retrieving configuration details from your connected device. 

Note, this is not available on some connected devices including Ruida.

## Main Toolbar


LightBurn's X & Y position, width, height, scale, and interval entry boxes now support expressions and units. What does this mean for you?

If you type 1/2in, and you're in mm mode, it'll turn into 12.7.  If you're in inch mode and type 1/2in, it'll become 0.5.  You can use ft, cm, in, or mm, along with normal math symbols and parenthesis (*/-+).  You can combine them, so entering (1/2in + 3mm) * 2.5 + 1ft is valid.  You can type 1/300in in the interval box to have it convert "300 lines per inch" into an interval for you. This should make working in mixed units easier.
